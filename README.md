Știrile Zilei - stirilezilei.eu is a simple website created on top of the [Academic theme](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/) for Hugo.

The website keeps the main theme's customizations. To fetch the data for the news, it uses the [jquery.rss](https://github.com/sdepold/jquery-rss) plugin. With this plugin you can read a RSS feed and transform it into a custom piece of HTML.

To pass the feed, I used a widget developed in the Academic Theme and passed it a hugo shortcode with jquery/html.
